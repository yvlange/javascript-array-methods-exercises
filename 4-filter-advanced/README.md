# Exercise 4: filter advanced

Given an array of objects representing TV Shows, we want to create
3 new arrays:

- One including only the TV Shows that were watched (`{ watched: true }`)
- One including only the TV Shows that have a rating greater or equal to 9
- One including only the TV Shows that were first published before 2015

Create this 3 arrays using the `filter` method.
`console.log` the newly created arrays to finish. Verify that they are including the correct tv shows.
