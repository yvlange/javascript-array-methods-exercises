# Exercise 3: filter basics

Given an array of school grades (german version, from 1 to 6), we want to create
2 new arrays:

- One including only the grades lower than 3
- One including only the grades greater or equal to 3

Create this 2 arrays using the `filter` method.
`console.log` the newly created arrays to finish. Verify that they are including the correct numbers.
