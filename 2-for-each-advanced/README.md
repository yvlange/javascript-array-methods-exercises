Given an array of movies, iterate over them using the `forEach` method of the array type and `console.log` every movie in the array preceded by the index.

You can't use a variable for that. Check the resources to see how the you can do it just by using the `forEach` method.

## Example output

```
1.Matrix
2.Blade Runner
3.The Lord of the Rings
4.Avatar
5.Brokeback Mountain
6.Inglorious Bastards
7.The Hateful 8
```
