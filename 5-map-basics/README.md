# Exercise 5: map basics

Given an array of numbers from 1 to 8, we want to create 3 new arrays:

- One including the numbers doubled (multiplied by 2) (1 -> 2, 2 -> 4, etc)
- One including the numbers divided by 2
- One including the numbers multiplied by themselves

Create this 3 arrays using the `map` method.
`console.log` the newly created arrays to finish. Verify that they are including the correct numbers.
